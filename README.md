*PRODIGY_DS_2: Prodigy Infotech Internship
Welcome to my GitHub repository for internship tasks at Prodigy Infotech, where I am currently working as a Data Science Intern.
This repository showcases projects designed to enhance practical skills in data analysis and visualization, utilizing tools like Microsoft Excel and Power BI.

*About the Project
This project focuses on analyzing the sales performance of ABC Company during the financial year 2013-14.
The primary objective is to assess the company's profitability across key dimensions, such as:

*Countries
*Segments
*Markets
*Product Categories
Using Power BI, I created dynamic and interactive reports connected to diverse data sources. 
I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover relationships between key variables, including sales, product categories, pricing, and more.

*Task 2: Data Cleaning and EDA in Power BI
Key highlights of this task include:
*Cleaning the dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability in the analysis.
*Performing EDA to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.

*Visualizations in Power BI
To effectively analyze and represent data, I developed the following visuals:
*Pie Charts
*Column Charts
*Donut Charts
*Bar Charts
*Line Charts
*Card Visuals
*Slicers
These visuals were instrumental in examining the relationship between total sales and factors such as pricing, country, region, and market. This task laid a strong foundation for leveraging Power BI as a powerful data analysis tool.
